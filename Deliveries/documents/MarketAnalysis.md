## Rate My Professors

Rate My Professors is a website that allows you to leave a score on a professor at your university.

To use the application you have three alternatives:

1. Search for a professor, it will ask for the institution's name and the professor's name, then you will be able to see the professor's profile, with an average rating of 0 to 5, also the comments that different students have left about him, in those comments you will see the level of difficulty of their subject, the quality of teaching, if he ask for a book, if attendance is relevant and a short review for the teacher.

2. Search for a university and see the reviews that students leave about it, from comments to find out if the internet is good, if the school cafeteria provides good service, if the library is good, managing a rating from 0 to 5.

3. To qualify a teacher, first you will have to add the teacher's name and it will show you the match that it makes with the teachers and the universities where he teaches their subject. Then the system gives you some tips on how you should evaluate a teacher, check the grammar of your comment and correctly specify your course, talk about the teacher's skills, how he teaches the subject and how clear he is when speaking, his class dynamics, the system also advises you that you should not make offensive comments towards the teacher, or denigrate his profession, nor should you say if he has favorites or something like that, irrelevant topics. After reading the tips, you start by adding the subject taught by the teacher, asking for a grade from 0 to 5 towards the teacher, also the level of difficulty of the course, later asking if you would take a course with the professor again, if he asks you for a book, if the assists are relevant, your grade obtained in the course and finally, a review of the teacher.

This website allows you to create an account to display your comment generated to the teacher, however, it also allows you to leave the comment anonymously.
