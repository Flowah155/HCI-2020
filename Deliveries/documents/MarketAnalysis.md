## AutisMIND

AutisMIND is an app to stimulate the development of Mind Theory and social thinking in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.

AutisMIND contains 10 different themes related to aspects of the Theory of Mind, with 6 levels of increasing difficulty and more than 1,000 recreational and interactive exercises.

In this application, the themes chosen focus on precursor skills to social thinking, such as joint attention or the ability to symbolize, without these it is very difficult to develop the Theory of Mind, which allows the child to infer mental states in the other and adjust their own behavior to adapt to a given situation.

### Topics addressed:

* Joint attention
* Secondary emotions
* Interpretation of
* emotions by context
* Physical sensations
* Organs of the senses
* Basic emotions
* Global perception
* Anticipation of actions
* Symbolization
* Visual perspectives


Some of the most important features of the app include:

* **Simple and intuitive use:** designed for accessible navigation for people with ASD.

* **Immediate feedback and positive reinforcement:** motivate the child and let him know instantly if he has done well or what would be the correct answer if that is the case.

* **Learning without error:** the app offers aids, tutorials and visual aids to avoid frustration and ensure a successful learning without error.

* **Detailed follow-up of the evolution:** it records the response time, the successes and errors of the child and allows you to consult the evolution at any time, also allows you to export the charts in pdf to evaluate the effectiveness and performance.

* **Multi-user:** the app allows the creation of different users for professional use, being able to create different profiles and use it with different children.

* **Customizable configuration:** allows you to adapt the application to suit each child, allowing you to program some features and choose reinforcement, support, etc.

In clinical practice with children with ASD, specific intervention is essential to stimulate ToM and facilitate social thinking. A deficit in this ability inevitably affects the development of social skills and the establishment of positive social interactions, making adaptation and subsequent integration in the context difficult.

Through AutisMIND, the development of ToM can be stimulated in different ways, (individually or in groups) and in different contexts (in the classroom, at home, in a treatment session ...) although it is recommended that it be used guided by a facilitator who act as an aid to learn, think, debate and reflect on the different situations and exercises presented. This allows children to comment and explain their different points of view, listen to others, provide examples of situations experienced and cooperatively, find a solution to the problems raised.

When implementing any technological resource with people with special educational needs (SEN), some aspects must be taken into account, always promoting good use and avoiding abuse. The misuse of some applications or devices can have iatrogenic consequences and generate habits that, once established, can be very difficult to change.

Another important aspect is portability; due to batteries, internet and the cloud, the information can be available anywhere, greatly facilitating the generalization of learning to all user contexts, as well as enabling the joint participation of the network of professionals and families that accompany the people with ASD.

## TICO Project

TICO Project (Tableros Interactivos de COmunicación) is a computer application to generate and use communication boards interactively. The program consists of two independent and differentiated but complementary applications: Editor and Interpreter.

With the editor's application you can create communication boards with contain visual, auditory or environment control elements.

With the interpreter's application, the boards previously created with the editor's application can be visualized to develop communicative limitations and to help specialists in their therapies.

Although, the problems of social cognition arise when trying to externalize the thoughts as well as when internalizing them, this type of activities, such as following a communication process through cards that help you to externalize the thoughts through mechanics such as performing consecutive actions Well, regularly children with these types of problems believe that we all know what goes through their mind.
 
Having several boards to structure and outsource your thoughts becomes a great help, because the child can add structures to order an object or express what he feels, for example: "I" + " feel" + " happy". The child, being able to outsource structures of that style, exercises his communication and adds central and global coherence to his language.
