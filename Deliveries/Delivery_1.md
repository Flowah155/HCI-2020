# Learning the context of use

## Identifying target users

### Research techniques

#### Interview

Get to know the users through the lens of an expert in the field. (Expert opinion). This accelerates and deepens understanding of users. Regarding structure, semi-structured interviews were chosen to provide a balance between quantitative data collection and qualitative discussions. Audio of each interview is recorded when interviewee provides consent and when the context allows it.

#### Observation

In addition to the expert opinion gathered during interviews, observation of the users provides a better understanding of their context of use, challenges and needs. The observation is performed directly when children are in a session of social cognition therapy.

#### Persona

This tool helps focus user gathered information into a concise representation. Personas can be used to prioritize requirements according to user's needs and goals as well as to avoid discussion and implementation of unnecessary features. Additionally, key non-funcional requirements may be present in instances of this tool. Regarding structure, the following characteristics are considered for a persona:

| Characteristic | Description and provided value |
|---|---|
| Photograph | A photograph helps humanize the persona, reminding everyone that we are designing for people who have specific challenges, goals, needs, etc. |
| Name | Similarly to a photograph, a name makes it easier to empathize with the persona. |
| Age | Demographic data that is very likely to shape other characteristics of the persona. |
| Mental disability | Specific diagnosis. This has a broad impact on the persona and can further provide information by focusing literature revision. |
| Family | Family is a key part of a person's social life and it is important to understand family compositions. |
| Needs | What are the current unmet needs of our users. This includes any resource or support currently lacking in the context of use. |
| Goals | We want to understand user's ultimate goals to ensure our product enables them to achieve them in the best way possible. This has an impact on prioritization of functional requirements. |
| Challenges | This encompasses any barrier that is present to the user and indicates what elements we should avoid and, if necessary to include, what elements we should provide special consideration in their design. Key non-functional requirements could be present here. |
| Affinity to technology | This provides an baseline indicator for how likely the product is to be adopted by our target users. |
| Familiar/Anxious about | To increase ease of adoption and satisfaction of use, it is important to understand what the users are comfortable and familiar with. On the other hand, we should strive to avoid including in the design any element which is anxious-provoking. |
| Context of use | How, when and with whom is the product used. |

### Exploratory interviews

The purpose of the exploratory interviews was two-fold: (1) gather initial and general information about children with ASD in Mérida, Yucatán and (2) explore any problems they have related with language.

The first approach we had in the field was through a semi-structured interview with Víctor Prudencio, an occupational therapist who has ample experience working with children diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Here we understood that language, focus and socializing are common challenges for children with ASD. These findings aligned with our reading of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-5.

To further understand children with ASD and their challenges associated with language, we conducted an semi-structured interview with Ashanty Pérez, a language therapist who has 20 years of experience working with children with ASD and specializes on developing theory of mind with patients over 3 years old. She also works with low and high-technology Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, and informed us that children have much higher adoption of high-technology mediums (i.e. mobile apps). We also learned that language development is key to children's wellbeing, as it allows  him or her to effectively communicate desires and needs. AAC devices are widely used for this purpose, and they don't only improve life-quality of these children, but also of their relatives.

A next-step challenge, related with language, for children who have become comfortable with expressing basic needs and desires through AAC tools, is developing social cognition: understanding social situations, which includes comprehending other people's feelings, thoughts, beliefs and how they differ from the own.

#### TICO Project

TICO Project  (Tableros Interactivos de COmunicación) is a computer application to generate and use communication boards interactively.
The program consists of two independent and differentiated but complementary applications: Editor and Interpreter.

With the editor's application you can create communication boards with contain visual, auditory or environment control elements.

With the interpreter's application, the boards previously created with the editor's application can be visualized to develop communicative limitations and to help specialists in their therapies.
