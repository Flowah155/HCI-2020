## Definition and justification of the problem

The problem that will be the focus of our project can be concisely summarized in the following sentence:

<p align="center">
    <b>Low development of social cognition in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).</b>
</p>

According to the [APA Dictionary of Psychology](https://dictionary.apa.org/social-cognition), social cognition is defined as follows:

> Cognition in which people perceive, think about, interpret, categorize, and judge their own social behaviors and those of others. The study of social cognition involves aspects of both cognitive psychology and social psychology. Major areas of interest include attribution theory, person perception, social influence, and the cognitive processes involved in moral judgments.

In simpler terms, social cognition is a topic covered by various branches of psychology and it refers to the cognitive processes related with perceiving, understanding and applying information about the own and other people's feelings, desires and thoughts.

Social cognition is known to be particularly underdeveloped in people diagnosed with ASD. Symptomatic evidence of this can be confirmed by the [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5)](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm) on the diagnosis criteria of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Several deficits related with social cognition are mentioned in criterion *A* and its sub-items, among which some points are:

* "Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction [...]".
* "Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions."
* "Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships".

Additionally, on an interview with Ashanty Pérez, a therapist with 20 years of experience working with _theory of mind_ (a super-set of social cognition) therapies for children with ASD, we understood that low development of social cognition is evidently observed in communication difficulties which hinder basic interaction with other people, accomplishment of simple goals and initiation of social interactions. This might lead to isolation and has a clear impact on wellbeing.

## Research planning

Tasks are planned using a Gantt chart generated in [Wrike](https://www.wrike.com/), a work planning application. Since it is not possible to produce a view-only url to the chart, an image of the past activities is provided below.

Tasks in blue are not completed, whilst tasks in green are done. For this delivery our debt comprises the definition of target users. Although we have defined the user [research techniques](#research-techniques), observations are yet to be made and more data needs to be collected to build correct and useful personas.

## Identifying target users

### Research techniques

Before investing time into defining a proposal to tackle the aforementioned problem, knowing our target users will definitely prove very valuable in the later ideation phase of the project. For the purpose of identifying target users several techniques are used.

#### Interview

Get to know the users through the lens of an expert in the field. (Expert opinion). This accelerates and deepens understanding of users. Regarding structure, semi-structured interviews were chosen to provide a balance between quantitative data collection and qualitative discussions. Audio of each interview is recorded when interviewee provides consent and when the context allows it.

#### Observation

In addition to the expert opinion gathered during interviews, observation of the users provides a better understanding of their context of use, challenges and needs. The observation is performed directly when children are in a session of social cognition therapy.

#### Persona

This tool helps focus user gathered information into a concise representation. Personas can be used to prioritize requirements according to user's needs and goals as well as to avoid discussion and implementation of unnecessary features. Additionally, key non-funcional requirements may be present in instances of this tool. Regarding structure, the following characteristics are considered for a persona:

| Characteristic | Description and provided value |
|---|---|
| Photograph | A photograph helps humanize the persona, reminding everyone that we are designing for people who have specific challenges, goals, needs, etc. |
| Name | Similarly to a photograph, a name makes it easier to empathize with the persona. |
| Age | Demographic data that is very likely to shape other characteristics of the persona. |
| Mental disability | Specific diagnosis. This has a broad impact on the persona and can further provide information by focusing literature revision. |
| Family | Family is a key part of a person's social life and it is important to understand family compositions. |
| Needs | What are the current unmet needs of our users. This includes any resource or support currently lacking in the context of use. |
| Goals | We want to understand user's ultimate goals to ensure our product enables them to achieve them in the best way possible. This has an impact on prioritization of functional requirements. |
| Challenges | This encompasses any barrier that is present to the user and indicates what elements we should avoid and, if necessary to include, what elements we should provide special consideration in their design. Key non-functional requirements could be present here. |
| Affinity to technology | This provides an baseline indicator for how likely the product is to be adopted by our target users. |
| Familiar/Anxious about | To increase ease of adoption and satisfaction of use, it is important to understand what the users are comfortable and familiar with. On the other hand, we should strive to avoid including in the design any element which is anxious-provoking. |
| Context of use | How, when and with whom is the product used. |

### Exploratory interviews

The purpose of the exploratory interviews was two-fold: (1) gather initial and general information about children with ASD in Mérida, Yucatán and (2) explore any problems they have related with language.

The first approach we had in the field was through a semi-structured interview with Víctor Prudencio, an occupational therapist who has ample experience working with children diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Here we understood that language, focus and socializing are common challenges for children with ASD. These findings aligned with our reading of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-5.

To further understand children with ASD and their challenges associated with language, we conducted an semi-structured interview with Ashanty Pérez, a language therapist who has 20 years of experience working with children with ASD and specializes on developing theory of mind with patients over 3 years old. She also works with low and high-technology Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, and informed us that children have much higher adoption of high-technology mediums (i.e. mobile apps). We also learned that language development is key to children's wellbeing, as it allows  him or her to effectively communicate desires and needs. AAC devices are widely used for this purpose, and they don't only improve life-quality of these children, but also of their relatives.

A next-step challenge, related with language, for children who have become comfortable with expressing basic needs and desires through AAC tools, is developing social cognition: understanding social situations, which includes comprehending other people's feelings, thoughts, beliefs and how they differ from the own.

## Market analysis

The preliminary market analysis done for this delivery can be found in a [separate document](documents/MarketAnalysis.md). The purpose of this research and analysis is to understand what has been developed and what features or areas are still unexplored by the market.

## Metrics

### Individual contribution and project progress

> This metric has been applied to the first delivery of the project. The detailed application can be found in a [Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PG3QAMMSaIHhpFBE-icTz4Kvc2XZR41v1gc5CbGukCs/edit?usp=sharing).

The project is divided in deliveries defined by the professor of the course, Edgar Cambranes. Each delivery has activities and each activity has the following attributes:

* **Complexity Points (CP):** The scale is based on Fibonacci sequence (3, 5, 8 and 13). Instead of using consecutive integers, the Fibonacci sequence was preferred because points scale better, highlighting those who contribute the most. The CP for each activity is assigned in a team meeting, guaranteeing consensus.
* **Delivery Percentage of Completion:** Percentage assigned to each activity based on the total percentage delivery activities. It is defined as the product of the activity CP by the ratio of one hundred among the total number of delivery activities. `(100 / total number of activities) * Activity CP`.
* **Criteria:** Define the sub-activities done in each activity and depending on those sub-activities, the team can have a better idea of ​​how many CP each member deserves.
* **Number of points assigned to each member:** Every activity has a specific CP that is divided among team members that worked on the activity. The whole team decides how many CP of the activity will be assigned to each member (distribution doesn't have to be equal). CP sum of all members who worked on the activity has to be the same as the total CP of the activity.

The individual contribution is calculated for each delivery. The calculation is done by dividing one hundred by the total CP of the delivery. The result is multiplied by the total CPs of each team member and the result is expressed in a percentage. The sum of the individual contribution percentage of each team member in a delivery is the current delivery progress.
