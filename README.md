# HCI 2020

As part of the human-computer interaction (HCI) 2020 course of the Software Engineering major at [UADY, FMAT](https://www.matematicas.uady.mx/), students were required to write a reflective diary about HCI-related topics. The entries of each team member are found in their folder in [ReflectiveDiaries](ReflectiveDiaries).

For the development of the final course project, user-centered design approach is used.

## User-Centered Design

User-centered design is an iterative approach to problem solving that focuses on users on every step of a product's design and development. This approach consists of three general phases:

1. **Learning the context of use**. This phase covers specifying the target users and understanding the context of use of the product. It is very important to have a clear understanding of the problem at this stage.
2. **Prototypes**. This is a multi-part phase, which covers specification of requirements, design and implementation of prototypes; although, requirements and design might be separated in intermediate phases. For this project, prototyping covers the aforementioned tasks.
3. **Evaluation**. The evaluation of prototypes is performed through usability testing with actual users. This can provide valuable insights into the quality of software requirements and improve design to better meet users' needs.

## Project Deliveries

There will be three formal project deliveries during the course. The activities done in each delivery are better explained below:

* [First delivery](https://github.com/HerCerM/HCI-2020/blob/master/Deliveries/Delivery_1.md): This delivery corresponds to the fisrt phase of the User-Centered Design methodology: **Learning the context of use.**  Here, we define and justify the problem that will be the focus of our project, and the research techniques we use to identify our target users. Also, we done a preliminary market analysis to know what has been developed and what features or areas are still unexplored by the market. For the team organization, we create a research plan where we record all the activities done for this delivery and we explained the metrics that we use to measure individual contribution.
