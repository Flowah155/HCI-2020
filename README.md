# HCI 2020

As part of the human-computer interaction (HCI) 2020 course of the Software Engineering major at [UADY, FMAT](https://www.matematicas.uady.mx/), students were required to write a reflective diary about HCI-related topics. The entries of each team member are found in their folder in [ReflectiveDiaries](ReflectiveDiaries).

Additional deliverables of the course can also be found in this repository.

For the development of the final course project, user-centered design approach is used.

## User-centered design

User-centered design is an iterative approach to problem solving that focuses on users on every step of a product's design and development. This approach consists of three general phases:

1. **Learning the context of use**. This phase covers specifying the target users and understanding the context of use of the product. It is very important to have a clear understanding of the problem at this stage.
2. **Prototypes**. This is a multi-part phase, which covers specification of requirements, design and implementation of prototypes; although, requirements and design might be separated in intermediate phases. For this project, prototyping covers the aforementioned tasks.
3. **Evaluation**. The evaluation of prototypes is performed through usability testing with actual users. This can provide valuable insights into the quality of software requirements and improve design to better meet users' needs.
