## 26.04.20 Folklore theories about opaque systems

> Brief reflection upon the second chapter of The Design of Everyday Things, by Don Norman.

A system that lacks visibility about how it works leaves a void of interpretation which can only be filled by users' imagination. This lack of visibility may cover the organization of components, the effect of the controls, feedback, interfaces and any other element relevant to user interaction.

For some of these systems, folk theories are developed that, similar to Aristotle's naive physics, are sensible but erroneous. In other words, people may develop shared and incorrect intuitions about how something works. What is interesting about these intuitions is that they do provide explanation about what the system doesn't show, but it is a flawed explanation that might lead to unnecessary actions or perceived cause relationships.

Don Norman provides a simple example: a thermostat. Many people seem to believe that in order to reach the desired temperature the fastest, the thermostat temperature should be set to its lowest or highest, cooling or heating the room faster this way. The thermostat provides partial visibility about how it handles temperature; it lets us know what is its target temperature, though it doesn't provide any indication about how much time it would take to reach the temperature. This lack of visibility leads to the belief that setting the temperature to a limit lowers the time to reach the limit. Since the theory is neither disproved nor supported by experience, it is kept held as it seems sensible.
