## 10.05.20 Interaction design

> Summary of [What is Interaction Design?](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-interaction-design) and [What is the difference between Interaction Design and UX Design?](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-the-difference-between-interaction-design-and-ux-design)

According to Interaction Design Foundation, _interaction design_ can be understood as "the design of the interaction between users and products" and its main goal is "to create products that enable the user to achieve their objective(s) in the best way possible".

Interaction design is a subset of user experience design. While the latter is concerned with user research, user testing and usability testing, the former merely focuses on interaction design elements insofar the interfaces between a user and a system.

Gillian Crampton Smith originally proposed four dimensions of interaction design, to which later  Kevin Silver added a fifth one. These dimensions are useful for understanding the scope of the discipline.

| Dimension | Explanation |
|---|---|
|Words| This is similar to the labeling system component of information architecture. Words and labels should convey with simplicity the necessary information to users to allow effective navigation and identification of content. |
|Visual representation| This refers to any graphic element, like images and icons. Visuals are often complementary to words. |
|Physical objects or space| Interaction between humans and systems is done through physical devices, and the nature of these devices very much shape how interaction occurs. For instance, interaction through mouse and keyboard is very different from that which occurs through a VR headset. |
|Time| This covers every design element which is sensible to time, such as dynamic content, visual and auditory feedback and animations. |
|Behavior| How the previous dimensions define the interaction with the product, including reactions and emotional responses. |
