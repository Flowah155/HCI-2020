## 27.03.20 Correlation between theory of mind and social cognition

As part of the research required to understand the domain knowledge of our project, understanding theory of mind and social cognition, as well as their relation, is key.

The original definition of theory of mind can be found in [Premack and Woodruff (1978)](https://carta.anthropogeny.org/sites/default/files/file_fields/event/premack_and_woodruff_1978.pdf), a study about chimpanzees:

_An individual has a theory of mind if he imputes mental states to himself and others. A system of inferences of this kind is properly viewed as a theory because such states are not directly observable, and the system can be used to make predictions about the behavior of others. As to the mental states the chimpanzee may infer, consider those inferred by our own species, for example, purpose or intention, as well as knowledge, belief, thinking, doubt, guessing, pretending, liking, and so forth._

On the other hand, in [Social Cognition in Humans (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207014923) by Chris D. Frith and Uta Frith, a concise paraphrasis of Ralph Adolph's definition of social cognition, presented in [Social cognition and the human brain (1999)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.119.6481&rep=rep1&type=pdf), is written as follows:

_Social cognition is the sum of those processes that allow individuals of the same species (conspecifics) to interact with one another._

Then the question is, how do theory of mind and social cognition correlate? Theory of mind is an ability, whereas social cognition is a set of processes. I believe theory of mind is an essential ability in the social cognition processes regarding conscious stimuli (as opposed to unconscious stimuli). (The distinction between both types of stimuli is described in [Social Cognition in Humans (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207014923).) It is important to distinguish that theory of mind and social cognition are areas of psychology that can both stand on their own (neither do they depend on each other, nor they contain the other).However, a strong correlation between social cognition and theory of mind exists insofar theory of mind is necessary for the conscious processes of social cognition. Generally speaking, social cognition is a broader field of study than theory of mind.
