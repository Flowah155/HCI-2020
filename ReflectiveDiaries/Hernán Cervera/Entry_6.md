## 28.03.20 Theory of mind in children with autism

To further understand the domain knowledge regarding our project proposal, I decided to research about what is the correlation between autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) in children and the cognitive ability to impute mental states in conspecifics (more succinctly known as theory of mind). The most remarkable paper that I was able to find is [Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"?](https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20%26%20Frith%201985.pdf) (1985), by Uta Frith _et al._, publication which seems to mark the beginning of theory of mind research in children with ASD. The thesis proposed is very insightful:

<p align="center">
The poor performance in social interactions seen in children with autism is not dependent upon a measure of intelligence accounted by IQ tests; further lies a yet unconsidered cognitive, and presumably underdeveloped, ability: theory of mind.
</p>

This thesis is increasingly interesting as the definition of theory of mind referenced in the paper is the original proposition found in [Premack and Woodruff (1978)](https://carta.anthropogeny.org/sites/default/files/file_fields/event/premack_and_woodruff_1978.pdf), a study about chimpanzees. However, instead of studying our close taxonomical cousins, Uta explored the concept in autistic children. She showed that even children with average IQ scores perform worse in theory of mind tests than down syndrome children with more severely impaired IQ. This is particularly interesting insofar theory of mind is a cognitive ability of its own; seemingly unlinked from logic, mathematics and other areas considered broadly into the definition of _intelligence_.

I find this brief research quite insightful regarding understanding our users and their challenges. Furthermore, this will surely help guide the research of therapies for the development of theory of mind in autistic children.
