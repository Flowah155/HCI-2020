> María del Rocío Fuentes Fernández, Carlos Iván Tinajar Bernabe, and Roberto Razo Rodríguez. 2014. Red Cross Triage App Design for Augmented Reality Glasses. In Proceedings of the 5th Mexican Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (MexIHC ’14). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 11–14. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/2676690.2676697

The application's objective is help in the Red Cross Triage process, this process is a standard used by paramedics during an emergency in which the severity of an injured person is identified through a series of steps, verifying from if the person can walk to if he or she can breathe or understand questions, this process serves to help paramedics to the transfer of the injured person to the nearest hospital that can attend to them according to the severity of their situation, during this process's final stage the application would also help since with the information collected it would seek the best hospital in a database.

The application categorization process to determine the severity of an injured person is as follows, the following paragraphs are taken directly from the referenced article:

_In the Triage Process App section you can see the following icons that make reference to the walkthrough of each of the steps used for the categorization process: the first one make reference to a walking person, in this case if the patient can walk on his own, he can be categorized as green. The second one makes reference to ventilation through the nose, if the patient can breathe it jumps to the 4th icon, but in the case that he can´t it goes to the 3rd; the third icon requires the paramedic to open the respiratory tract. In this case we have 3 possible results: a) if the patient breaths it goes to the 4th icon, b) if he doesn't breath but after opening the respiratory tract he breathed it continues to the next icon, c) if he doesn't breath and after opening the respiratory tract he still doesn't, it means he goes to the black category._

_The fourth icon, makes reference to the ventilation process and how many breathings per minute the patient has, if he has over 30 ventilations it is a red patient; if there is less than 30 ventilations per minute, it continues to the 5th icon: perfusion, where if he's capillary refill is above 2 seconds, we have a red patient, but if it is below 2 seconds, it continues to the final icon which needs to check if the patient responds to simple voice commands, in this case if he doesn't have a red patient, but if he does respond, we have a yellow patient._

The application would work on Google Glass devices because through a series of interviews and brainstorming with paramedics and specialized people from hospitals it was agreed that one of the main characteristics of paramedics is that they can have their hands free to be able to do all the actions necessaries during the Triage process, so it was agreed that the application would be carried out using AR since the Google Glass interface would be combined with the paramedic's view during the accident, so another important feature was that the application didn't obstruct the paramedic view.

The idea of ​​the application is quite good, however I see a negative point that isn't mentioned in the article, it is related to the cost of training and the purchase of the devices that these could have an excessive expense for the budget of the Red Cross.
