Maintaining work focus when using a computer is a major challenge. Computers support many different applications, and users may be unaware of the accumulated time they spend in non-critical activities. This article presents a real-time awareness application called meTime, which presents users with a simple visualization of their recent use of time across different applications.

The article begins mentioning how technology affects the productivity of people who use the computer as a work or study tool. It's interesting that to counteract the negative effects of technology, the authors propose a technological solution. This makes me reflect about the importance of considering the human factor when developing a software product, becasue technology represents a risk or helpful tool depending on the way in which people decide to use it. Therefore, if your application aims to make a person perform a certain activity, it's better to consider what behaviors affect humans when they perform it, by putting restrictions and offering tools to make the perform of the activity as effective as possible. In broad terms, this is what the UCD design philosophy proposes. You start by knowing your future users and how they operate in a certain scenario, then you make prototypes taking into account the information obtained and finally you carry out tests to validate that the proposed solution is adequate and usable.
