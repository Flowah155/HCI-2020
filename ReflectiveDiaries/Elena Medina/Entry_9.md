This paper proposes a common framework for classifying usability and UX measures, showing how they relate to broader issues of effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, accessibility and safety. Understanding how different aspects of user experience relate to usability, accessibility, and broader conceptions of quality in use, will help in the selection of appropriate measures.

This paper has been very useful, because help my team an I to understand how we should define usability requirements and metrics for our HCI's project. We decided to follow the ISO 9241-11 (1998) definition of usability, which is <em>"the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with **effectiveness**, **efficiency** and **satisfaction** in a specified context of use"</em>, to determine the aspects of usability we want to consider for our project's usability requirements.

Then, we follow the classification that this document proposes as a baseline to choose the metrics that best meet our requirements. Here are the metrics we choose for each usability aspect:

* **Effectiveness:** Completion rate, which is defined as the percentage of participants who correctly achieve a task.
* **Efficiency:** Average task completion time, which is defined as the average of time (in minutes/seconds) the participants take to successfully complete a task.
* **Satisfaction:** Likert Scale, which is is a five (or seven) point scale which is used to allow the individual to express how much they agree or disagree with a particular statement.

To conclude, this paper was of great importance to defining the usability requirements and metrics of my HCI project. Although we don't strictly follow the classification it proposes, it served as a atarting point to understand what usability represents in a software system in terms of how it is measured.
