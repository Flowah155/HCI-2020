# Planning

The tasks involved in completing the project are grouped into weekly efforts, where each week contains a group of specific, assigned and scheduled tasks. The detailed planning is done in Wrike, an organization tool. However, a summary of the organization is offered in this document.

## 23.03.20 - 29.03.20

## 30.03.20 - 05.04.20

As part of this week's sprint planning, the following activities were defined with their respective deliverables: [Research ToM therapies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mVJZRNQfsQbMU4wOVzBhgi0L1cwSy551NlgXd_g22eU/edit#) and [Justification attributes of Personas.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ivdCo5azvo9xewYFPAOjHrdXcpi-JXAWQLZkkfOdmk8/edit#heading=h.z08m6qmxj1md)

For each activity a minimum contribution was defined for each deliverable, in this way the activity can be considered and in parallel the members of them were defined. As part of the feedback of each assignments, a call will be made on the day of delivery of the same.

## 13.04.20 - 19.04.20
